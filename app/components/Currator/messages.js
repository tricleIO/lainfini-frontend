    defaultMessage: 'A whole team of designers with very distinctive styles work in collaboration with Atelier LAINFINI. Under the supervision of Mirka Talavašková, the chief designer and curator of the original designs, the first series of scarves and shawls was made with the utmost attention paid to luxury. These limited edition accessories embody the spirit of high quality feel with a wearable design. Each piece is handcrafted with artisanal care and enormous skill. The collection highlights all original prints featuring geometric patterns and abstract swirls, sprawling butterfly motifs, in rich tones of violet, cobalt, and sapphire, along with neutral creams, black, and white. The scarves and shawls transcend trends and seasons, designed to add a touch of serene elegance to any ensemble or seamlessly complement any wardrobe throughout the entire year beautifully. They were great examples of the wide range of Atelier LAINFINI production.',
